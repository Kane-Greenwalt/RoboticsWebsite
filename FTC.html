  <h1>Welcome to <i>FTC</i></h1>

<p>The FIRST Tech Challenge is designed for students in grades 7–12 to compete head to head, using a sports model. Teams are responsible for designing, building, and programming their robots in a 10-week build period to compete in an alliance format against other teams.</p>
<p>Colleen Shaver, an associate director of the university’s Robotics Resource Center, oversees the FIRST LEGO program in Massachusetts, one of the largest. She registers 460 teams with approximately 2,500 students, and organizes 13 competitions and two championships, including one competition and one championship hosted on campus. She points out that it’s important to get middle school students on the path to possible STEM careers. In addition to building robots, the students complete a project around a specific theme, talking with scientists, engineers, and other professionals in the process.

“The goal is to introduce them to careers in science and technology and to give them role models and goals they can work toward,” says Shaver. “We’ve seen them at 10 years out. They came here as nine-year-olds and if affected them, and they stayed connected to WPI.”

Brad Miller, an associate director of the Robotics Resource Center, who has developed WPILib  programs used to make FIRST robots go, sees FIRST as “a great STEM outreach program to get students to appreciate and pursue careers in STEM fields.”
