  <h1>Welcome to <i>FRC</i></h1>
  <body>
<p>We're FRC Team 6317- Disruptive Innovation, from Davenport West High School|Snapchat: West_Inspire |YouTube: West High INSPIRE|DavWestINSPIRE@gmail.com</p>
<p>The KOP is a term that’s evolved to mean “stuff we get from companies on behalf of, and provide to, FIRST Robotics Competition Teams.” These items then get to you, our customers, via three different methods:</p>

<p>the Kickoff Kit: items that we pack in totes (mostly in totes, there are typically exceptions for late or big items) and distributed to Teams at local Kickoff sites. There are two permutations of this – one set of items that goes to all Teams and a second container that goes to 1st year, aka “Rookie,” Teams
<br>FIRST Choice: FIRST Choice consists of an online menu of items available to 2018 FIRST Robotics Competition Teams, and it’s hosted by our friends at AndyMark (for free!). Its purpose is to make available a variety of goodies that Suppliers cannot provide in volumes to support all Kickoff Kits. Instead, Teams use a limited number of credits to pick and choose the items they prefer. Because of the limited inventory, we typically run out of popular items, but we’d rather make a variety of <br>items in limited quantities available than none at all.
the Virtual Kit: items donated by Suppliers, but don’t actually come to FIRST for redistribution. </p>
<p>Custom orders (like Bimba cylinders), software downloads, and Product Donation Vouchers all fit this category.</p>
